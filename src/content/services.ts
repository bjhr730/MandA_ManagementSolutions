/**
 * The seven services named in MA_Website_Development_Checklist.pdf:
 * "Property oversight, rent collection, maintenance, tenant relations,
 * inspections, renewals, leasing coordination".
 *
 * Every description is built from language the client already drafted in the
 * FAQ and checklists. Nothing claims a capability he has not stated — the
 * checklist item "Confirm actual services: align descriptions with
 * operational capacity and licensed activities" is still open.
 *
 * `brokerage: true` marks services the FAQ says run through the affiliated
 * licensed brokerage; those render with the brokerage disclosure attached.
