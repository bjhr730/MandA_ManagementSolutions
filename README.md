# M&A Management Solutions

Marketing website for **M&A Management Solutions of Virginia, LLC**, a
residential property management company serving Northern Virginia.

The site has one job: turn a property owner into a consultation request.
Everything else serves that.

- **Framework:** [Astro 5](https://astro.build) — static HTML, no client framework
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first config, no `tailwind.config.js`)
- **Forms:** Astro server route → Neon Postgres → Resend
- **Hosting:** Vercel

**Shipped to the browser: ~2.2 KB of JavaScript**, for the mobile menu. That is
the whole budget. Please keep it that way.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env    # then fill it in
npm run dev             # http://localhost:4321
```

| Script | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Production build into `dist/` and `.vercel/output/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |
| `npm run check` | `astro check` — TypeScript and template diagnostics |

Node 20.3+ is required. Vercel runs the deployed functions on Node 22; if you
develop on Node 24 you will see a harmless warning at build time.

### A note on the `rollup` override

`package.json` pins `rollup` to `@rollup/wasm-node`. This is a workaround for a
development machine where Windows Application Control blocks rollup's native
`.node` binary, which otherwise fails the build with `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED`. The
WASM build is a drop-in replacement and is slightly slower. If nobody is
building on a machine with that policy, delete the `overrides` block and run
`npm install` to go back to native rollup.

## Editing the content

All copy lives in `src/content/` as typed data. No CMS, no database, no admin
login — change the file, commit, and the site rebuilds.

| File | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `src/content/home.ts` | Home page hero, benefits, founder teaser |
| `src/content/about.ts` | About Us copy and the mission statement |
| `src/content/founder.ts` | Antonio's bio, pull-quotes and credential stats |
| `src/content/philosophy.ts` | The three guiding principles |
| `src/content/services.ts` | The seven services |
| `src/content/why-us.ts` | Why Choose Us reasons |
| `src/content/management-plans.ts` | Plans page, fee categories, what's included |
| `src/content/faq.ts` | The 13 FAQ entries, in the approved order |

Two config files hold everything else:

- **`src/config/site.ts`** — phone, email, address, hours, service areas,
  navigation, and the portal feature flag. Every unknown real-world fact is in
  here and marked `REPLACE`.
- **`src/config/compliance.ts`** — fair housing statement, brokerage
  disclosure, pricing disclosure, licence numbers.

### Turning the portals on

Buildium is not live yet. When it is, open `src/config/site.ts`, set
`PORTALS_LIVE = true` and fill in the two URLs. That one change reveals the
portal links in the footer and turns `/portals` from a "coming soon" page into
a real one. Until then, nothing on the site mentions a portal — which is what
the launch checklist requires.

### Turning off the pre-launch banners

`src/config/compliance.ts` exports `REVIEW_MODE = true`. While it is true, the
footer and the legal pages carry a visible notice that the disclosures have
not been reviewed. Set it to `false` only after a qualified Virginia
professional has signed off on that file.

---

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` locally; set the same keys as Vercel project
environment variables in production.

| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SITE_URL` | yes | Canonical origin, no trailing slash. Drives canonical tags, sitemap, robots.txt, Open Graph. |
| `SITE_INDEXABLE` | launch | Anything but `"true"` serves `Disallow: /` and a `noindex` meta on every page. Leave unset on staging; set to `"true"` in production at launch. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | prod | Without it, inquiries are still stored but no email is sent. |
| `INQUIRY_FROM_EMAIL` | prod | Must be on a domain verified in Resend. |
| `INQUIRY_TO_EMAIL` | prod | Where owner inquiries land. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | prod | Neon pooled connection string. |
| `PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | prod | Public; rendered into the page. |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | prod | **Secret.** If unset in production, every submission is rejected rather than left unprotected. Leave both blank locally to skip the check. |

## How the inquiry form works

`/contact` is the only route that is not static (`export const prerender =
false`). It handles its own `POST` so that a failed submission can re-render
with the values intact and each error attached to its field — no JavaScript
required. On success it redirects to `/thank-you` (303), so a refresh resends
nothing.

```
POST /contact
  ├─ honeypot check      → silently accepted, nothing stored
  ├─ zod validation      → re-render with errors + submitted values
  ├─ Turnstile verify    → skipped locally, enforced in production
  ├─ INSERT into Neon    ← stored FIRST, so an email outage cannot lose a lead
  ├─ Resend → Antonio    (reply-to is the inquirer)
  ├─ Resend → inquirer   (acknowledgement)
  └─ 303 → /thank-you
```

Storage and email failures are logged, not surfaced: once the row is in, the
person gets their confirmation either way.

### The database

One table. Create it with:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS inquiries (
  id               bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at       timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  name             text        NOT NULL,
  email            text        NOT NULL,
  phone            text,
  property_address text        NOT NULL,
  property_type    text,
  occupancy        text,
  involvement      text,
  timeline         text,
  message          text,
  source_ip        text,
  handled_at       timestamptz,
  notes            text
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS inquiries_created_at_idx ON inquiries (created_at DESC);
```

`handled_at` and `notes` are there so inquiries can be worked through without
needing a second system.

## Accessibility

Target is **WCAG 2.2 Level AA**, and it is verified rather than assumed: every
page audits clean under axe-core (`wcag2a`, `wcag2aa`, `wcag21aa`, `wcag22aa`
and best-practice rules).

What that means in practice:

- Semantic landmarks, one `<h1>` per page, no skipped heading levels.
- A skip link, and a focus ring that is never removed.
- The mobile menu is a native `<dialog>`, so the focus trap, Escape handling
  and background inerting are the browser's job, not ours.
- The FAQ is `<details>`/`<summary>` — zero JavaScript, correct semantics.
- The form has permanent visible labels, `autocomplete` attributes, inline
  errors tied by `aria-describedby`, and an error summary that the browser
  focuses natively because it is the form's fragment target.
- Spam protection is Turnstile, not a visual puzzle.
- Every text colour is contrast-checked against its surface; ratios are noted
  inline in `src/styles/global.css`.
- Dark mode follows the OS preference, with no toggle and no flash.

Re-run the audit by serving `axe.min.js` from `public/` and calling `axe.run()`
against each route, or point any axe-based tool at the dev server.

## Performance

| | |
| --- | --- |
| JavaScript shipped | ~2.2 KB (mobile menu only) |
| CSS | ~30 KB uncompressed, one file |
| Fonts | 2 × latin-only variable woff2, ~99 KB total, preloaded |
| Third-party requests | none, except Turnstile when configured |

No analytics, no tag manager, no web font CDN. If you add any of those, measure
first.

## Before launch

Owned by the business, not the code:

- [ ] Fill in every `REPLACE` in `src/config/site.ts` (phone, email, address, hours)
- [ ] Fill in `src/config/compliance.ts` (brokerage name, DPOR licence numbers)
- [ ] Have a qualified Virginia professional review `/privacy`, `/terms` and
      `/fair-housing`, then set `LEGAL_REVIEW_DATE` and `REVIEW_MODE = false`
- [ ] Verify the Virginia Fair Housing protected-class list is current
- [ ] Confirm the founder bio's property count (the two source drafts disagree:
      "approximately 60" vs "60–85")
- [ ] Add the real logo (replace `src/components/Logo.astro` and `public/favicon.svg`)
- [ ] Add Antonio's headshot — a 4:5 portrait, 1000×1250 or larger. Slots are
      already sized on `/` and `/founder`, so it drops in with no layout change.
- [ ] Re-run `node scripts/generate-images.mjs` after the logo lands
- [ ] Register the domain, set `SITE_URL`, verify the sending domain in Resend
- [ ] Set `SITE_INDEXABLE="true"` in production (and only production) so the
      site can be indexed
- [ ] Replace the Turnstile **test** keys in Vercel with real ones from the
      Cloudflare dashboard (staging currently uses the always-pass pair)
- [ ] Submit the live form end to end and confirm both emails arrive
- [ ] Set up the Google Business Profile once eligible

## Deploying

**Staging:** https://manda-management-solutions.vercel.app

The Vercel project `manda-management-solutions` is linked to this repository,
so every push to `main` deploys. The `@astrojs/vercel` adapter is already
configured; no build settings need changing.

Staging deliberately differs from production in three ways:

- `SITE_INDEXABLE` is unset, so the whole site is `noindex` and `robots.txt`
  serves `Disallow: /`.
- Turnstile uses Cloudflare's **published always-pass test keys**
  (`1x00000000000000000000AA` / `1x0000000000000000000000000000000AA`). These
  are documented dummy values, not credentials. They exist because the handler
  rejects every submission when `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is missing in
  production, which would otherwise make the staging form look broken.
  **Replace both with real keys before launch.**
- Resend is not configured, so inquiries are stored in Neon but no email is
  sent. That path is exercised by the code; it just has nowhere to send until
  a sending domain is verified.

### Why `security.checkOrigin` is off

Astro's built-in cross-origin POST check compares the `Origin` header against
the host it sees on the request. Behind Vercel's proxy that is not the host the
browser addressed, so it returned `403 Cross-site POST form submissions are
forbidden` on every submission, including same-origin ones. The equivalent
check now lives in `sameOrigin()` in `src/lib/inquiry.ts` and reads
`x-forwarded-host` first, so it is correct behind the proxy. Verified both
ways against the live deployment: a same-origin POST succeeds, a POST carrying
a foreign `Origin` is refused.

Static pages are served from the CDN. `/contact` runs as a serverless function
because it accepts `POST`.

## Project layout

```
src/
├─ components/   Header, Footer, Seo, JsonLd, Cta, FaqList, InquiryForm, ...
├─ config/       site.ts (facts), compliance.ts (disclosures)
├─ content/      all page copy, as typed data
├─ layouts/      BaseLayout.astro
├─ lib/          inquiry.ts (validate/store/notify), schema.ts (JSON-LD)
├─ pages/        one file per route; robots.txt.ts is generated
└─ styles/       global.css (tokens), fonts.css (@font-face)
```

Structured data is built in `src/lib/schema.ts`: `RealEstateAgent` with the
Northern Virginia service area, `Person` for Antonio, `FAQPage` on `/faq`, and
breadcrumbs on inner pages. It deliberately omits any field that is still a
placeholder — wrong structured data hurts local search more than none.
